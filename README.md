## Installation

The whole program is re-created after one years, simulating the initial functioning program. However, due to limited time at the current moment, the program is possibly unfunctionable and thus require further updates.

IDE(Integrated Development Environment): 

[Google Colab](https://colab.google/) for `.ipynb` development.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for `.py` development.

## Usage

### Program Structure

```

 ┣ unknown_author_with_great_examples
 ┣ COM2003_Catalyst.ipynb
 ┣ define_df.py
 ┣ output_df.py
 ┣ plot_df.py
 ┗ yfinance.cache
```

### Quick Start

The original codes are learnt from an unknown author, and unfortunately, the author has only posted his/her code on Medium.com, in which the account is removed. Below are some original links to the learning materials:

The code outside the folder `unknown_author_with_great_examples` are the ones I have written. 

To use the code, open the `COM2003_Catalyst.ipynb` file in `Google Colab`, the runtime configurations are as follow:

Then, insert the three Python files, namely `define_df.py`, `output_df.py`, and `plot_df.py` into `Files`.

`WARN: The files in "Files" will be deleted after runtime. It is best to save it in another secure location.`
